            The Book is a comprehensive guide to Chai starting from the very
            basics to the most advanced topics of the language.  It is the
            recommended quickstart text for beginners and a useful reference for
            language veterans.  It also serves as the primary language reference
            for Chai.  Work through it gradually and slowly: you won't finish it
            in one day.
