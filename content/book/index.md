# The Book

The Book functions as a comprehensive guide to the Chai programming language,
covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced topics.  If you reach the
conclusion of the book, you will have covered everything you will need to know
about programming in Chai.  This book acts as the official reference for the
entire programming language but is not written to be excessively dry or formal.

The teaching approach for the book is focus more on "example" rather than just
dry rules.  Sample programs and snippets with be presented throughout the text
to help you more concretely grasp the usage and behavior of the various concepts
discussed throughout the book.

It is not a quick read: you should expect to work through this book over
multiple sessions.  We strongly recommend that you play around with the language
as you read the book so you can practice and cement what you are learning.  

This book assumes the reader already has basic knowledge of programming and
computer science (eg. variables, functions, loops, dependencies, etc.).  The
main reason is to avoid reexplanation of topics most readers already understand
and to allow the book to focus on content specific to Chai.

## Structure

The book is subdivided into chapters each of which contain various sections
(pages). Each section may be further segmented into subsections to improve
readability.

The book begins with a "tutorial introduction" of sorts which familiarizes
readers with the basic concepts of the Chai programming language.  THe purpose
of this section is the get you to be able to write "useful" programs early on
without having to comb through an entire guide.  This introduction spans the
first chapter.

The remaining chapters are dedicated to cover the features and structure of Chai
in mostly linear order.  Due to the complex nature of the Chai programming
language, it is often impossible to document everything in perfect order: some
chapters may reference material from other chapters.  However, the tutorial (ie.
first chapter) should help to familiarize you with the language enough that such
references will be easy enough to follow.

The book ends with a series of appendices that mostly just lists of various
items and tables of usages.  This primarily exists as a reference material.

## Installation

This book assumes you have already installed Chai and set up a suitable
development environment.  If you have not already done this, then go ahead and
check out the [install](/install) page for more information.  

You do not need to have any other tools set up to work with Chai. 

## Coding Style

While Chai does not enforce any particular "styling guidelines" on the
programmer, there are some conventions that are recommended to help make Chai
projects more consistent and widely maintainable.  These practices are outlined
in the [Style Guide](/docs/style-guide).  After you finish with this book and
have spent some time getting comfortable in Chai, you should most definitely
give it a read.

This book, while it attempts to exemplify good practices when coding, does not
officially address any such styling concepts. 

## Standard Library

Chai has an ever-growing standard library that provides a lot of common functionality
to its programmers.  While you do not need to master this library, you should
absolutely attempt to learn as much of it as is useful to you.  

The book does explore *some* of the basic functionality provided such as IO, sequence
operations, and concurrency, but it does not nearly cover the breadth and depth of
the standard library.  

In order to truly master Chai, you need to be able to work cohesively with its
standard library.  So, we also recommend taking a look at the 
[Standard Library Reference](/packages/std) for more information about the
various tools offered to you.
